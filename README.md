Diamond Price Prediction Project Explanation
Introduction:
This project delves into the realm of data science, exploring its 
potential in predicting diamond prices. Our objective is to 
develop a model capable of accurately forecasting the price of a 
diamond based on its various characteristics.
1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
We obtained a diamond price dataset from Kaggle, 
encompassing information such as carat weight, color, clarity, 
and cut.
To ensure data integrity, we meticulously scrutinized the data 
for missing values and inconsistencies before proceeding with 
analysis.
2. Data Exploration:
Leveraging tools like pandas and seaborn, we embarked on a 
journey of data exploration to gain a deeper understanding of 
the feature distribution and their relationships with diamond 
price.
Visualizations revealed intriguing correlations between price 
and all other features.
4. Feature Engineering:
We create a new column called volume from features x, y, z.
3. Preprocessing:
To enable the machine learning model to effectively process 
categorical features (color, clarity), we employed 
OrdinalEncoder to transform them into numerical 
representations.
With the aim of potentially enhancing model learning, we 
introduced a new feature, "Maximum Cluster Similarity," 
utilizing the K-Means clustering algorithm. This feature groups 
diamonds with similar depth ranges.
StandardScaler was employed to ensure all numerical features 
were on the same scale, optimizing model performance.
4. Model Building and Evaluation:
a) Training and Testing:
We experimented with various machine learning models:
LinearRegression: Offering simplicity and interpretability, 
serving as a valuable baseline for evaluation.
we got a train error near to 800$
TreeRegressor: Capable of handling complex relationships 
between features and price.
The error was lower than 10$, which means there is an 
overfitting.
RandomForest: Effectively reducing overfitting risk and 
enhancing prediction accuracy.
With an error near to 210$ 
XGBoost for Improved Performance:
To achieve even better results, we employed XGBoost, a 
powerful tree-based ensemble method.
By carefully tuning the hyperparameters of XGBoost, we 
attained a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 202.
Best Hyperparameters:
{'xgb_regressorsubsample': 0.8, 'xgb_regressorn_estimators': 
500, 'xgb_regressormin_child_weight': 1, 
'xgb_regressormax_depth': 8, 'xgb_regressorlearning_rate': 
0.02, 'xgb_regressorgamma': 0.1, 
'xgb_regressorcolsample_bytree': 1, 
'preprocessingdepth_cluster__n_clusters': 17,
'preprocessing__Volume__with_volume':False}
b) Evaluation Metrics:
We evaluated the performance of the models using metrics like 
mean absolute error. The model demonstrating superior 
performance achieved a low MAE.
